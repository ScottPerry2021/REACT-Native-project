This project is designed to get a grip on the basic concepts of React Native. 
First, we’ll go through the framework’s fundamental aspects. 
After the basics have been covered, we are going to make our mobile application, a “To-do” app. 
This application is all about improving productivity as it will allow us to add, manage, and remove tasks.
