REACT Native template_ starter

React Native is the most popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications. 
This framework has made it possible to create native mobile apps for multiple platforms simultaneously. 
You can develop full-blown mobile applications for both iOS and Android using a single language, i.e., JavaScript. 



...as it saves a lot of time and money and also eliminates the steep learning curves that are associated 
with each platformâ€™s native development language (Java or Kotlin for Android, and C or C++ for iOS).
